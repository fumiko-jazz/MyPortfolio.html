    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a computer science student with a growing passion for web development and cybersecurity. I began learning Python in grade 10 and am currently learning C++ to strengthen my programming foundation.
      I enjoy building websites and exploring how to protect systems through ethical hacking and security tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to create secure, intelligent systems that benefit others—especially in education and learning. I’m working hard to earn a scholarship to study at Monash University, while also freelancing to gain real-world experience and support my education.
