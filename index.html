      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Ponhvorntey</strong>, a Computer Science student born in 2007 with a strong passion for
        technology, creativity, and global culture. This site is a reflection of my journey, filled with self-taught
        experiments, collaborative projects, and community leadership efforts.

      <h2>📚 My Tech Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My coding journey began with <strong>Code.org</strong>, where I built a fun <em>car racing game</em>. From there, I
        explored <strong>Scratch</strong> for animations and game logic, which sparked my interest in how things work behind
        the scenes. Eventually, I stepped into real coding using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, with help
        from AI tools like ChatGPT.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, building things from scratch, and sharing tech knowledge with others. My dream is to
        specialize in <strong>cybersecurity</strong> so I can help protect systems and people on the internet.

      <h2>👩‍🏫 Leadership & Community</h2>
      <p>
        I'm proud to lead a <strong>youth tech training club</strong> where I guide young girls toward STEM careers. We run
        workshops, build simple apps, and create tech-based solutions together. I also volunteered with the
        <strong>Global Peace Alliance Cambodia</strong> and participated in educational exhibitions to promote studying
        abroad.
